        School gardens are a wonderful way to use the schoolyard as a classroom, reconnect students with the natural world and the true source of their food, and teach them valuable gardening and agriculture concepts and skills that integrate with several subjects, such as math, science, art, health and physical education, and social studies, as well as several educational goals, including personal and social responsibility.

        It was shown by statistics that many pupils were backward in their studies only because of lack of physical vitality. The school has the services of an experienced nurse to constantly monitor the health condition and to take care of the primary medical aids to the students and the school has a medical room with all facilities for the first aid.

              <p class="p_modal">Smartclass is a digital initiative, which is rapidly transforming the way teachers teach and students learn in schools with innovative and meaningful use of technology. Powered by the world’s largest repository of digital content mapped to Indian School Curriculum, smartclass brings in technology right next to the blackboard for teachers in the classrooms. Students learn difficult and abstract curriculum concepts watching highly engaging visuals and animations. This makes learning an enjoyable experience for students while improving their overall academic performance in school.

The school has tied up with Educomp for setting up Smartclass in the school classrooms. With the introduction of EDUCOMP SMART CLASS teaching has been made more interesting for the students.

First released in October 2012, this book is the seventh book belonging to the special edition series. The readers will find the book very gripping and interesting as they will be able to experience the mystery themselves and solve it as and how the story proceeds, just like the Thea sisters did.

The book, ‘The Journey to Atlantis’ describes the journey of five mice who set on a voyage in the ocean. It was when Paulina was basking in the beach in the vicinity of the Mouseford Academy, that her attention is drawn to a very charming yet mysterious boy with a blue tinted skin. The boy was at the shore. The Thea sisters proceeded towards the boy in an attempt to talk to him. However, the unfamiliar language that he spoke in left all of them startled and they were all curious to know more about him. With no delay, they contacted Thea Stilton. Curious and excited herself, Thea arrives at the location and collects her mouselings and begins her new adventure; to try as hard as she can to find the whereabouts of the blue skinned boy.
